= Fabrique CI configuration

We use
http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder[Jenkins Job Builder]
to manage our Continuous Integration setup.


== Setup

To set up Fabrique jobs on your Jenkins instance:

* copy `jenkins_jobs.ini.sample` to `jenkins_jobs.ini` and customize
  the following fields:

  `url`::
  Full URL to your Jenkins instance (e.g., https://server.example.com/jenkins/)

  `user`::
  your Jenkins username

  `password`::
  API token generated from https://server.example.com/jenkins/me/configure

* run `make check` to test the configuration
* run `make upload` to actually upload the new job configurations
